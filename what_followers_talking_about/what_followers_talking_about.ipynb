    "### Loading followers on Twitter \n",
    "\n",
    "* The application already loads the followers ids from actors, but it is still dependent on the existence of configuration for InfluentialFollower. A first step would be to turn these two mecanisms independent from each other, since the followers will be also needed for the new feature of \"what followers are talking about\"\n",
    "* Another mecanism must be created to load the followers since the oldest ones and store all followers of our active businesses using the Twitter API as described previously.\n",
    "* With all followers in our database, the next step is to find a statistically significant sample of followers for each actor of each active business and store it in a new Twitter list (which may be associated to our account or the account of the business). The maximum number of lists is 1000 which is a much greater limit above the 118 Twitter handles of our current active businesses. In order to prevent this limit of being exceeded in the future, it could be reasonable to creat the lists on clients' accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading tweets from followers through Rules (*primary alternative*)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create mechanism for allowing the creation of rules for \"followers\", so that not only the current logic of Trending Hashtags/URLs can be applied over it but all other existent alerts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Manually loading tweets from followers (*secondary alternative*)\n",
    "\n",
    "* With the lists configured, read tweets from each list using the API as previously described. Twitter API's rate limit for this operation allows us to load all lists of all actors (118) of all current active businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach for scoring popularity for manually loaded tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First:** Simple TF (Term-Frequency) calculation for Hashtags and URLs.\n",
    "* **Second:** Based on the obtained data and quantities, define a threshold T such that if TF/n_followers > T then the Hashtag/URL is considered *what followers are talking about*. Consider the attribute \"created_at\" in order to discard old \"popular\" hashtags/URLs. Define a timeframe threshold too.\n",
    "* **Third:** Both thresholds of **second** topic can be defined with a default value a configurable through a new FollowersTalkingAboutConfiguration on Admin.\n"
