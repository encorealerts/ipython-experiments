    "\n",
    "## 4.1) Wordpress PowerTrack Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "* **keyword** - Matches a keyword within an activity's tokenized body.\n",
    "* **contains:** - Matches a keyword within an activity's body just as a substring operation, with no tokenization.\n",
    "* **exact phrase match** - Matches an exact phrase within the body of an activity.\n",
    "* **proximity operator** - Example: *\"keyword1 keyword2\"~N* where specified keywords must be no more than N tokens from each other. N cannot be greater than 6.\n",
    "* **from:** - Matches any activity from the specified user.\n",
    "* **url_contains:** - Matches activities with URLs that literally contain the given phrase or keyword. Considers both shortened and expanded URLs.\n",
    "* **has:links:** - Matches activities which contains one or more links in the body.\n",
    "* **lang:** - Matches activities that have been classified by Gnip as being of a particular language (if, and only if, the activity has been classified).\n",
    "* **has:lang** - Matches activities which Gnip has classified as any language.\n",
    "* **sample:** - Returns a random sample of activities that match a rule rather than the entire set of activities.\n",
    "* **post_title:** - Matches an exact phrase within the title of a posted article.\n",
    "* **post_title_contains:** - Matches a substring within the title of a posted article.\n",
    "* **activity_url_contains:** - Matches activities where the activity URL (i.e. permalink) contains the given phrase or keyword. URL encodings are not encoded at this time. To search for patterns with punctuation in them (i.e. cnn.com) enclose the search term in quotes.\n",
    "* **is:like** - Matches only activities that are Likes/Un-Likes.\n",
    "* **is:article** - Matches only activities that are posted articles.\n",
    "* **is:comment** - Matches only activities that are comments.\n",
    "* **publisher:** - Matches the Automattic publisher, Wordpress.com, Wordpress.org, or IntenseDebate."

    "# 5) Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1) Trending Tags/URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tags and URLs may be included in articles, thus allowing identification of trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tags are included in a separate list attribute within article activities, whereas URLs must be manually extracted from activities' content or objectively searched through **url_contains** operator, which matches both shortened and expanded URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2) Keywords and phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "General keywords and phrases may also be easily searched by using the operators **keyword**, **contains** or **exact phrase match**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator **post_title_contains** can be used for matching substrings in the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3) Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally to the topics **5.1** and **5.2**, article activities also hold an attribute **wpCommentsCount** which indicates the total number of comments that the article received.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Likes** and **Un-likes** may also me added to popularity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.4) Influencers\n",
    "\n",
    "For deducting the influence of a given actor who authored a post, **Likes** and **Un-likes** may be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation states that these two types of feedback activities are addressed to articles, saying *nothing about comments*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, with a simple assumption, as more *likes* a given actor receives in his/her articles, more he/she may be considered an *influencer*. \n",
